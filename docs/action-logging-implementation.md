# Action Logging Implementation - Complete System

## Overview

This document describes the comprehensive action logging system implemented to track AI resolution attempts, including success/failure tracking and storage integration. The system provides detailed visibility into every action the AI takes during incident resolution.

## System Architecture

### 1. ActionLogger Service (`src/services/action_logger.py`)

**Core Components:**
- `ActionAttempt` class: Tracks individual action execution attempts
- `ActionLogger` service: Manages logging, storage, and retrieval of action data
- JSON-based storage in `data/action_logs/` directory
- Comprehensive step-by-step execution tracking

**Key Features:**
- **Detailed Action Tracking**: Each action attempt captures:
  - Action ID, type, and parameters
  - Incident ID association
  - Start/completion timestamps
  - Execution status (pending, in_progress, success, failed)
  - Step-by-step execution logs
  - Error messages and exception details
  - Execution time metrics

- **Real-time Statistics**: 
  - Success/failure rates by action type
  - Average execution times
  - Recent attempt history
  - Incident-specific action tracking

### 2. Enhanced ActionService (`src/services/actions.py`)

**Integration Points:**
- `_action_executor` method enhanced with comprehensive logging
- Detailed exception handling and step tracking
- Automatic attempt initialization and completion logging

**Logging Details:**
```python
# Action attempts are logged with:
- Pre-execution validation steps
- Parameter validation and sanitization
- Execution progress tracking
- Success/failure outcome recording
- Exception details for debugging
```

### 3. AI Decision Engine Enhancement (`src/ai/__init__.py`)

**Enhanced Capabilities:**
- `_execute_automated_actions` method updated with comprehensive logging
- Resolution summary generation and storage
- Action attempt coordination and tracking
- Detailed success/failure analysis

**Resolution Summary Features:**
- Total actions attempted vs successful
- Overall resolution success tracking
- Detailed action execution timeline
- AI confidence scoring integration

### 4. Database Schema Extensions (`docker/postgres/init-action-logging.sql`)

**New Tables:**
- `action_attempts`: Individual action execution records
- `resolution_attempts`: High-level resolution session tracking
- `action_logs`: Detailed step-by-step execution logs
- `resolution_metrics`: Aggregated performance metrics
- `failure_patterns`: Pattern analysis for failure detection

**Advanced Features:**
- Automatic metrics calculation via triggers
- Indexed queries for performance
- Views for common analytics queries
- Failure pattern detection and analysis

### 5. Enhanced Resolution Monitoring API (`src/api/resolution_monitor.py`)

**New Models:**
- `ActionAttemptDetail`: Comprehensive action execution details
- `ResolutionDetail`: Enhanced incident resolution with action tracking

**Enhanced Endpoints:**
- `/recent`: Lists resolutions with detailed action execution logs
- `/{incident_id}`: Shows detailed action attempts for specific incidents
- `/metrics`: Real-time metrics from action logger data
- `/live-feed`: Live activity feed from recent action attempts

## Data Flow

### 1. Action Execution Flow
```
1. AI Engine identifies required actions
2. ActionLogger.start_action_attempt() → Creates ActionAttempt
3. ActionService._action_executor() → Executes with detailed logging
4. ActionAttempt.log_step() → Records execution progress
5. ActionAttempt.mark_success/failure() → Completes attempt
6. ActionLogger.complete_action_attempt() → Saves to JSON storage
7. Database triggers → Update aggregated metrics
```

### 2. Monitoring Integration
```
1. Resolution Monitor API queries ActionLogger
2. Real action data enhances monitoring endpoints
3. Live metrics calculated from logged attempts
4. Historical analysis from stored action data
```

## Storage Strategy

### JSON Logs (`data/action_logs/`)
- **Purpose**: Real-time action attempt storage
- **Format**: One JSON file per action attempt
- **Benefits**: Fast writes, easy debugging, local development friendly
- **Structure**:
```json
{
  "attempt_id": "uuid",
  "action_id": "action_identifier", 
  "action_type": "restart_database_connection",
  "parameters": {...},
  "incident_id": "inc_001",
  "started_at": "2025-01-20T10:15:30Z",
  "completed_at": "2025-01-20T10:15:52Z",
  "status": "success",
  "logs": [
    {"step": "initialization", "status": "started", "timestamp": "..."},
    {"step": "execution", "status": "in_progress", "timestamp": "..."},
    {"step": "completion", "status": "success", "timestamp": "..."}
  ],
  "execution_time_seconds": 22.0
}
```

### PostgreSQL Database
- **Purpose**: Long-term storage, analytics, and reporting
- **Benefits**: ACID compliance, complex queries, scalability
- **Integration**: Batch import from JSON logs for historical analysis

## Usage Examples

### 1. Starting Action Logging
```python
from src.services.action_logger import ActionLogger

action_logger = ActionLogger()

# Start logging an action attempt
attempt = action_logger.start_action_attempt(
    action_id="restart_db_001",
    action_type="restart_database_connection", 
    parameters={"database": "postgresql", "timeout": 30},
    incident_id="inc_001"
)
```

### 2. Logging Execution Steps
```python
# Log execution progress
attempt.log_step("validation", "in_progress", {"checking": "connection_pool"})
attempt.log_step("execution", "started", {"restarting": "database_service"})

# Mark completion
attempt.mark_success({"connection_pool_size": 10, "response_time": "22ms"})
# OR
attempt.mark_failure("Connection refused", {"error_code": "ECONNREFUSED"})
```

### 3. Retrieving Action Statistics
```python
# Get recent statistics
stats = action_logger.get_action_statistics(days_back=7)
print(f"Success rate: {stats['success_rate']:.2%}")

# Get incident-specific attempts
attempts = action_logger.get_action_attempts_by_incident("inc_001")
for attempt in attempts:
    print(f"Action: {attempt['action_type']} - Status: {attempt['status']}")
```

### 4. Monitoring API Integration
```bash
# Get recent resolutions with action details
curl "http://localhost:8000/api/resolution-monitor/recent?include_action_details=true"

# Get specific incident with action logs
curl "http://localhost:8000/api/resolution-monitor/inc_001"

# Get real-time metrics from action logger
curl "http://localhost:8000/api/resolution-monitor/metrics"
```

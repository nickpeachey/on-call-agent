# Continuous Learning System

The AI On-Call Agent includes a sophisticated continuous learning system that improves its decision-making capabilities over time by learning from resolution outcomes.

## üß† How It Works

### 1. **Resolution Outcome Recording**
After each incident resolution attempt, the system records:
- Actions taken with detailed metadata
- Success/failure status
- Resolution time
- Confidence score of the original decision
- Service-specific identifiers (DAG IDs, database connections, Spark application IDs)

### 2. **Learning Feedback Generation**
The system analyzes each outcome to generate learning feedback:
- **Pattern Match Strength**: How well the incident matched known patterns
- **Action Sequence Effectiveness**: Success rate of individual actions
- **Performance Metrics**: Resolution time compared to historical averages
- **New Pattern Discovery**: Identification of new failure/success patterns

### 3. **Model Adaptation**
Based on learning feedback, the system:
- Adjusts confidence thresholds dynamically
- Updates pattern recognition capabilities
- Improves action sequence recommendations
- Builds a knowledge base of effective resolutions

## üìä Key Features

### Service-Specific Metadata Extraction

The system extracts detailed metadata for precise targeting:

#### Airflow DAGs
- `dag_id`: Specific DAG identifier
- `dag_run_id`: Execution run identifier
- `task_id`: Individual task identifier
- `execution_date`: When the DAG was scheduled to run

#### Database Connections
- `host` and `port`: Database server details
- `pool_size`: Connection pool configuration
- `error_code`: Specific database error codes
- `timeout_duration`: Connection timeout settings

#### Spark Applications
- `application_id`: Unique Spark application identifier
- `executor_id`: Specific executor that failed
- `stage_id` and `task_id`: Fine-grained execution details
- `memory_config`: Driver and executor memory settings

#### Kubernetes Pods
- `pod_name`: Specific pod identifier
- `namespace`: Kubernetes namespace
- `container_name`: Container within the pod
- `node_name`: Physical node location

### Continuous Learning Feedback

Each resolution creates a learning record with:

```json
{
  "incident_id": "unique_identifier",
  "timestamp": "2024-12-01T10:30:00Z",
  "actions_taken": [
    {
      "action": "restart_dag_task",
      "target": "data_pipeline.transform_data",
      "dag_id": "data_pipeline",
      "dag_run_id": "dag_run_20241201_083000",
      "result": "success",
      "duration": 45
    }
  ],
  "success": true,
  "resolution_time": 90,
  "confidence_score": 0.85,
  "learning_feedback": {
    "confidence_score": 0.85,
    "resolution_effectiveness": 0.975,
    "pattern_match_strength": 0.78,
    "action_sequence_effectiveness": 1.0,
    "new_patterns_learned": ["fast_resolution_pattern"],
    "performance_metrics": {
      "resolution_faster_than_average": true,
      "action_sequence_optimal": true,
      "resource_usage_efficient": true
    }
  }
}
```

## üéØ Targeting Capabilities

### Before Enhancement
- Generic "restart service" actions
- Manual intervention often required
- No specific targeting of failed components

### After Enhancement
- **Precise DAG Targeting**: `restart_dag_task("data_pipeline", "transform_data")`
- **Specific Database Pool Management**: `increase_pool_size("prod-db:5432", from=20, to=40)`
- **Targeted Spark Recovery**: `restart_spark_app("app-20241201083045-0001", memory="8g")`
- **Kubernetes Pod Recovery**: `restart_pod("worker-pod-123", namespace="production")`

## üìà Learning Statistics

The system tracks comprehensive learning metrics:

```python
stats = await ai_engine.get_learning_statistics()
```

Returns:
- **Total Incidents**: Number of incidents processed
- **Success Rate**: Overall resolution success percentage
- **Average Resolution Time**: Mean time to resolve incidents
- **Recent Success Rate**: Performance trend (improving/declining)
- **Confidence Threshold**: Current decision-making threshold
- **Learning Trends**: Direction of improvement

## üöÄ Benefits

### 1. **Improved Accuracy**
- Learning from failures reduces repeat mistakes
- Pattern recognition improves over time
- Confidence thresholds adapt to real-world performance

### 2. **Faster Resolution**
- Specific targeting reduces trial-and-error
- Action sequences optimized based on historical success
- Reduced escalation to human operators

### 3. **Service-Specific Intelligence**
- Deep understanding of Airflow DAG behavior
- Database connection pool optimization
- Spark memory management expertise
- Kubernetes pod lifecycle management

### 4. **Continuous Improvement**
- Self-adjusting system parameters
- Growing knowledge base of solutions
- Adaptive learning from environment changes

## üß™ Testing

Run the continuous learning test to see the system in action:

```bash
cd /Users/nickpeachey/Developer/projects/on-call-agent
python scripts/test_continuous_learning.py
```

This will:
1. Simulate realistic incident scenarios
2. Demonstrate metadata extraction
3. Show learning feedback generation
4. Display learning statistics and trends

## üìÅ Data Storage

Learning data is stored in:
- `data/continuous_learning.json`: Live learning records
- `data/sample_training.json`: Enhanced training examples
- Model files: Stored in `models/` directory

## üîß Configuration

The learning system can be configured through environment variables:

```bash
# Learning parameters
AI_CONFIDENCE_THRESHOLD=0.6          # Minimum confidence for automated actions
AI_LEARNING_RATE=0.1                 # How quickly to adapt from feedback
AI_MAX_LEARNING_HISTORY=1000         # Maximum incidents to keep in memory

# Model training
AI_RETRAIN_INTERVAL=24                # Hours between model retraining
AI_MIN_TRAINING_SAMPLES=10            # Minimum samples before retraining
```

This continuous learning system ensures that your AI On-Call Agent becomes more effective over time, learning from every incident to provide better, faster, and more accurate automated resolutions.
